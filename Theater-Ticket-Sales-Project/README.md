##Problem:##
Write a program that can be used by a small theater to sell tickets for performances. The theater’s auditorium has 15 rows, with 30 seats in each row. The program should display a screen that shows which seats are available and which are taken. 

The program should ask for the ticket type (Thursday Night - 8pm, Friday Night - 8pm, Saturday Night – 8pm, Saturday Matinee - 3pm, and Sunday Matinee - 3pm). Ticket Prices – Thursday Night/Saturday Matinee/Sunday Matinee ($20.00); Friday Night/Saturday Night ($40.00).
The program should also ask for how many adult and child tickets. A child ticket is discounted at 50% for all shows.
Tasks to perform:
1. •	The user may enter the row and seat numbers for tickets being sold.
2. •	Every time a ticket or group of tickets is purchased, the program should display the total ticket prices and update the seating chart.
3. •	The program should keep a total of all ticket sales. The user should be given the option of viewing this amount. Display report to include:
 o	Ticket sales by type 
 o	Adult ticket sales
 o	Child ticket sales
 o	Total of all ticket sales 
 
•	The program should also give the user an option to see a list of how many seats have been sold, how many seats are available in each row, and how many seats are available in the entire auditorium.
Input validation: When tickets are being sold, do not accept row or seat numbers that do not exist. When someone requests a particular seat, the program should make sure the seat is available before it is sold.
